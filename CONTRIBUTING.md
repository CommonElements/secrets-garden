## Contributing Guidelines

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes** - Fix existing issues
- **Features** - Add new functionality
- **Documentation** - Improve docs, examples, or comments
- **Tests** - Add or improve test coverage
- **Security** - Security improvements or vulnerability fixes

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** - Look for existing issues or discussions
2. **Create an issue** - For significant changes, create an issue first
3. **Discuss the approach** - Get feedback before starting work
4. **Check the roadmap** - Ensure your contribution aligns with project goals

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write code following our style guide
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Run tests and linting**
   ```bash
   # Run full test suite
   pytest

   # Run with coverage
   pytest --cov=secrets_garden

   # Run security tests
   pytest -m security

   # Lint code
   ruff check secrets_garden tests
   ruff format secrets_garden tests

   # Type checking
   mypy secrets_garden

   # Security scanning
   bandit -r secrets_garden
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

5. **Push and create pull request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Code Style and Standards

### Python Code Style

We use automated tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **Ruff** for linting and import sorting
- **MyPy** for type checking
- **Bandit** for security scanning

### Commit Message Convention

We follow conventional commit format:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Test additions or modifications
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `security:` - Security improvements
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add export command for secrets
fix: resolve memory leak in crypto module
docs: update installation instructions
test: add integration tests for vault manager
security: implement constant-time comparison
```

### Type Hints

All new code should include type hints:

```python
def encrypt_secret(plaintext: str, password: str) -> EncryptedData:
    """Encrypt a secret with the given password."""
    # Implementation here
```

### Documentation Strings

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def create_vault(path: Path, password: str) -> VaultManager:
    """Create a new vault at the specified path.
    
    Args:
        path: Directory path for the new vault
        password: Master password for the vault
        
    Returns:
        VaultManager instance for the new vault
        
    Raises:
        VaultAlreadyExistsError: If vault already exists at path
        VaultError: If vault creation fails
    """
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

- **Unit tests** - Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration tests** - Test component interactions
- **Security tests** - Test security properties and edge cases
- **CLI tests** - Test command-line interface

### Writing Tests

1. **Test file naming**: `test_<module_name>.py`
2. **Test function naming**: `test_<functionality>_<scenario>`
3. **Use fixtures**: Leverage pytest fixtures for common setup
4. **Test edge cases**: Include boundary conditions and error cases
5. **Security focus**: Add security-specific test cases

Example test:

```python
def test_encrypt_decrypt_roundtrip(crypto_manager: CryptoManager):
    """Test that encryption and decryption work correctly."""
    password = "test-password"
    plaintext = "secret message"
    
    encrypted_data = crypto_manager.encrypt(plaintext, password)
    decrypted = crypto_manager.decrypt(encrypted_data, password)
    
    assert decrypted == plaintext
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for >95% test coverage
- Focus on critical security code paths
- Include error handling tests
- Test CLI commands and user interactions

## Security Considerations

### Security-First Development

- **Review crypto code carefully** - All cryptographic code needs thorough review
- **No hardcoded secrets** - Never commit secrets or keys
- **Input validation** - Validate all user inputs
- **Error handling** - Don't leak sensitive information in errors
- **Memory safety** - Clear sensitive data from memory when possible

### Security Testing

- Add security-specific tests for new features
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Verify that sensitive data is properly cleared
- Test against common attack vectors

### Cryptographic Changes

For changes to cryptographic code:

1. **Discuss first** - Security changes need community discussion
2. **Expert review** - Get review from cryptography experts
3. **Extensive testing** - Include comprehensive security tests
4. **Documentation** - Update security documentation

## Documentation

### Types of Documentation

- **Code comments** - Explain complex logic
- **Docstrings** - Document public APIs
- **README** - High-level project information
- **Security docs** - Security model and implementation
- **Examples** - Usage examples and tutorials

### Documentation Standards

- Keep documentation up to date with code changes
- Use clear, concise language
- Include practical examples
- Document security implications
- Update CHANGELOG.md for significant changes
